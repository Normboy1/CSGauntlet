# ðŸš€ Manual GitHub Setup - CS Gauntlet

## âœ… Git Repository is Ready!

I've already initialized your git repository and committed all files. Now follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `cs-gauntlet`
3. **Description**: `Real-time competitive programming platform with AI-powered code grading`
4. **Make it Public** (so others can see your awesome project!)
5. **DON'T check** "Add a README file"
6. **DON'T check** "Add .gitignore" 
7. **DON'T check** "Choose a license"
8. **Click**: "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy These Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. **IGNORE THOSE** and use these instead:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Normboy1/cs-gauntlet.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Copy and paste each command one by one into your terminal.**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Free Hosting!)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Normboy1/cs-gauntlet
2. **Click**: Settings (top menu)
3. **Scroll down** to "Pages" (left sidebar)
4. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
5. **Branch**: main
6. **Folder**: / (root)
7. **Click**: Save

## Step 4: Wait and Test

- **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build your site
- **Your site will be live at**: https://normboy1.github.io/cs-gauntlet

## ðŸŽ® What You're Deploying

Your CS Gauntlet platform includes:
- âœ… **AI-powered code grading** with Ollama

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Live Site

- Username: `bob` / Password: `password123`

## ðŸŽ¯ If You Get Stuck

If any command fails:
1. Make sure you're in the `h:\cs_gauntlet` folder
2. Make sure you created the GitHub repository first
3. Copy/paste commands exactly as shown
4. If push fails, you might need to authenticate with GitHub
