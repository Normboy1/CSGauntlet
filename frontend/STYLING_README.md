# IMPORTANT: CS Gauntlet Frontend Styling Preservation

This document serves as a critical guide for maintaining the exact styling and design integrity of the CS Gauntlet frontend application.

## DO NOT MODIFY THE STYLING

The styling, colors, and overall design aesthetic of this application are FINAL and SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.

## Why This Is Important

The dark theme with indigo accents has been carefully designed and implemented. It provides:

1. **Consistent user experience** across all parts of the application
2. **Optimal readability** for code snippets and text content
3. **Brand identity** through the specific color palette
4. **Accessible contrast ratios** for all users

## Reference Templates

Two comprehensive reference documents have been created to help maintain styling consistency:

1. **`STYLING_GUIDE.md`**: A visual guide for designers and developers
2. **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**: Technical implementation details with exact code examples

## For AI Assistants

If you are an AI assistant helping with this project:

- **ALWAYS** refer to the styling guides before implementing new features
- **NEVER** suggest or implement changes to the color scheme or base styling
- **ALWAYS** use the exact Tailwind CSS classes specified in the guides
- **MAINTAIN** the dark theme (black/dark gray backgrounds with white text)
- **PRESERVE** all styling characteristics including:
  - Dark backgrounds
  - White/light gray text
  - Indigo accent colors
  - Rounded corners on components
  - Shadow effects on cards
  - Consistent spacing

## For Project Maintainers

When adding new components or features:

1. Reference the styling guides first
2. Use the provided example components as templates
3. Ensure all new elements match the existing design system
4. Test all new components in dark mode to verify readability

## Example HTML Structure

The HTML file `exact-frontend-copy.html` in the project root provides a complete reference of all styled components and can be used as a visual guide for how the application should look.

By maintaining styling consistency, we ensure a professional, cohesive user experience throughout the CS Gauntlet application.
